### Lane Detection using C++ : 
  This project implements a lane detection system using custom image processing techniques, specifically for automotive safety applications. It processes a frame from a video or camera feed to detect lane markings and tracks their positions over multiple frames.

### Project Overview: 
  The goal of this project is to detect lanes in a given frame using a series of image processing steps and then track these lanes across subsequent frames. The detection process utilizes basic image processing methods like grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, edge        detection, region of interest masking, and Hough Transform.
  This implementation aims to simulate how autonomous vehicles or advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) can visually understand lane information.

### Key Features: 
  Lane Detection: The system detects lane markings in the input frame using custom image processing techniques.
  Lane Tracking: It tracks lanes over multiple frames to smooth the detected lines and reduce jitter.
  Region of Interest (ROI): Focuses processing on the region of the image that most likely contains the lane markings.
  Visual Feedback: Draws detected lanes on the frame to visually indicate lane positions.
  System Requirements
  To run the project, you'll need:

  C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
  OpenCV library (for image processing and computer vision operations)

### How It Works:
## The lane detection process consists of several stages:

# 1. Grayscale Conversion
   Converts the input image to grayscale to simplify further processing. This step removes color information, leaving only intensity.
## 2. Gaussian Blur
   A Gaussian blur is applied to the grayscale image to reduce noise and smooth out high-frequency details. This helps in detecting the broader lane patterns.
## 3. Edge Detection
   Using a custom edge detection technique (similar to the Canny edge detection), the blurred image is processed to detect edges in the image. This is where lane markings become visible.
## 4. Region of Interest (ROI) Masking
   A mask is created to focus processing on a triangular region of interest that likely contains the lanes. This is a common technique to reduce computational complexity by eliminating irrelevant areas like the sky or distant road boundaries.
## 5. Hough Transform
   The Hough Transform is applied to detect straight lines within the region of interest. This algorithm identifies the lane markings by detecting lines in the edge-detected image.
## 6. Lane Tracking
   Detected lines from previous frames are tracked by averaging their positions. If the lines in the current frame are not detected, the previous lines are used to maintain the lane detection. This smooths out the lane detection over time.
## 7. Visual Feedback
   The final step draws the detected lanes on the original frame and displays the result. If there’s any significant lane deviation, an alert is displayed on the frame.

### Future Improvements:
   1. Better Lane Detection Algorithms: Experiment with different algorithms to detect more complex lane patterns.
   2. Real-Time Processing: Implement optimizations to process frames in real-time for use in autonomous vehicles.
   3. Machine Learning: Explore machine learning techniques to enhance lane detection, especially in challenging conditions like poor lighting or curved roads.
   4. Camera Calibration: Implement a camera calibration process to remove lens distortion and improve the accuracy of lane detection.
